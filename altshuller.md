Genrich S. Altshuller, the inventor of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), analyzed patents systematically to understand the patterns of inventive problem-solving. His analysis focused on identifying how problems were solved creatively and what made certain solutions inventive. His approach:

1. **Study of Large Patent Sets**  
   Altshuller analyzed around 40,000 patents (later expanded by others to over 2 million). He focused on understanding not just the technical details but the essence of the problem and its solution.

2. **Focus on Inventive Solutions**  
   He distinguished between routine improvements (low-level inventions) and truly inventive solutions (high-level innovations). He paid attention to breakthroughs that overcame significant contradictions.

3. **Contradictions as a Core Concept**  
   Altshuller observed that inventive solutions often resolved contradictionsâ€”situations where improving one aspect of a system would traditionally degrade another. For example, making a material stronger might make it heavier. Solutions that overcame such contradictions without compromise were considered inventive.

4. **Identification of Patterns**  
   He identified recurring patterns in inventive solutions, such as common strategies or methods used to resolve contradictions. This led to the formulation of **40 Inventive Principles** and the **TRIZ Contradiction Matrix**.

5. **Levels of Innovation**  
   Altshuller categorized inventions into five levels based on their originality and impact:
   - Level 1: Routine design improvements.
   - Level 2: Minor improvements through known methods.
   - Level 3: Solutions using new concepts within the same field.
   - Level 4: Breakthroughs involving multiple disciplines.
   - Level 5: Rare, groundbreaking discoveries.

6. **Abstracting Problems and Solutions**  
   Altshuller abstracted problems and solutions from specific contexts to identify universal problem-solving methods. This abstraction allowed TRIZ to be applied across diverse fields.

7. **Principles of Ideal Final Result (IFR)**  
   He noted that the best solutions strive for an ideal state where the problem is solved with minimal resources or complexity.

By analyzing patents in this structured way, Altshuller created a systematic framework for innovation that could be taught and replicated, forming the foundation of TRIZ. This method shifted innovation from an intuitive art to a more scientific discipline.
