# CyberShu

**CyberShu** is an open-source project that combines the systematic problem-solving methodology of TRIZ with AI to analyze cybersecurity patents. By automating the analysis of contradictions, resolutions, and trends, CyberShu aims to uncover hidden insights in the realm of cybersecurity threat detection.

---

## **Features**
- **TRIZ-Driven Patent Analysis**: Leverages the principles of TRIZ to extract contradictions and map inventive solutions.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to analyze large patent datasets.
- **Cybersecurity Focus**: Tailored specifically to uncover trends, gaps, and opportunities in threat detection innovation.
- **Visualization**: Generates intuitive visualizations for trends, contradictions, and interdisciplinary insights.

---

## **Goals**
1. Automate Altshuller’s TRIZ methodology to analyze patents at scale.
2. Uncover new patterns and contradictions that humans may overlook.
3. Inspire innovation in cybersecurity by identifying gaps and novel opportunities.
